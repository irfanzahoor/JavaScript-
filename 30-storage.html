    <p>Local storage is like a little storage space inside your web browser. It allows websites to save small pieces of
        information, like settings or preferences, directly on your device. This means that even if you close the
        website or shut down your computer, the information will still be there when you come back, making it handy for
        things like saving your login details or keeping track of your preferences on a website.</p>
